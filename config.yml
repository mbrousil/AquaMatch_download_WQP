# This config file allows for three types of pipeline operation:
#
# 1) default: download a new set of files from WQP. This is most useful if you 
# are customizing the download.
#
# 2) admin_update: for use by the ROSS group to update stable versions of the 
# harmonization pipeline. This config option requires write access to the ROSS
# Google email.
#
# Default: provide email and drive folder and use dynamic, user-created local versions
# of the WQP download.
